## Datadog

Datadog is an amazing tool that lets you leverage extensive power and visualization techniques to visualize your GitHub actions like never seen before. With some minor configuration, you can get insights into your workflows outside of what you’ll get within GitHub.

You can do this yourself by creating an account at [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) – just click the *free account* link in the top-right corner and fill out the form. Then, you simply install a local collector (the thing that processes/scrapes the events) and follow the steps from there.

Follow the steps outlined here to continue the rest of the way:
[Configure the Datadog integration](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/pipelines/github/#configure-a-github-app).

If you just want to see the capability of this without the fuss of installing it, then check out the Datadog blog post that covers the features available at
