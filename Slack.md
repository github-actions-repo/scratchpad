## Integrating GitHub Actions with Slack

Slack is a widely used team collaboration platform that provides real-time messaging, file sharing, and integration capabilities. Integrating GitHub Actions with Slack allows you to receive notifications, updates, and alerts from your workflows directly within your Slack channels. This section explores how to set up the integration and leverage its benefits.

The following are the benefits of integrating GitHub Actions with Slack:
* `Real-time notifications`: Receive real-time notifications in your Slack channels when specific events occur, such as workflow run status changes, completed deployments, and failure alerts. Stay informed about the progress and outcomes of your workflows without leaving the Slack environment.
* `Team collaboration`: Foster collaboration and transparency within your team by sharing workflow updates, successes, and failures in a centralized space. Team members can discuss, provide feedback, and take immediate actions based on the notifications received.
* `Streamlined communication`: Avoid the need for manual sharing of updates or checking individual workflow run statuses. The integration enables automatic updates within Slack, reducing the effort required to stay up to date with workflow progress.
* `Efficient troubleshooting`: Receive immediate alerts in Slack channels in case of workflow failures or errors. This allows teams to quickly identify and address issues, improving the overall troubleshooting and resolution process.

**Installing the app into the workspace**

First, you’re going to want to install the application into a Slack workspace, as mentioned in the Technical requirements section.

1. When you log in to your Slack workspace, there is an `Apps` collapsible section in the left-hand panel. Expand it and click the `Add apps` link, and you’ll then be presented with an app search screen.
2. Search for `github` and select the app called `GitHub` (there is also one named `GitHub Enterprise Server`, but you don't want this one) from the list returned:
3. Once navigated to the installation page, click `Add to Slack` and subsequently approve the installation:
4. Once installed, you'll get a screen like the following:
5. Click the `Connect GitHub account` button and follow the prompts to receive a six-digit code. Once you have this code, come back to this screen, click the `Enter Code` button, and enter the code in there.
   
   Once this is done successfully, you will get a screen like the following:
6. We won't go into all the functionality presented here, as a lot of it comes with a plethora of documentation, but the key one I use is `Subscribe`. The output of a subscription can be seen in the following screenshot:
   
   ```
   /github subscribe github-actions-repo/scratchpad
   ```

7. We'll look at how we can send data from a workflow to a chat within Slack.
